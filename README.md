# weather-dashboard
## Description
For module 6's challenge we were asked to create a weather app displaying the current weather of a searched city, as well as the 5 day forcast of that city. This challenge we were asked to use the Open Weather Map api. For this chalenege we used HTML, CSS, JavScript, bootstrap, and 3rd party API's. During this challenge I struggled a bit with getting the api all set up correctly. I did a lot of DOM manipulation with the forcast and appending it to the page / creating the elements within JavaScript. This challenge really made me go over JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It helped me solidify my knowedge in those areas. I also feel a but more comfortable with event listeners, and when they are neeeded.
